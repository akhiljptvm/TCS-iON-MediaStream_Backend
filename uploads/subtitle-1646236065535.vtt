00:00:01.533 --> 00:00:03.433
Deadly predators
aren't something

00:00:03.433 --> 00:00:06.100
we expect in our own backyard.

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:09.899
But here at Keith Jackson's
farm in the Scottish highlands,

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.734
they're an age old problem.

00:00:12.734 --> 00:00:15.934
Highland cattle were once
preyed on by everything from

00:00:15.934 --> 00:00:19.099
brown bears to packs of wolves.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:23.166
And though those predators are
long gone from the Highlands,

00:00:23.166 --> 00:00:27.400
the cow's instinct to
escape them has remained.

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.366
The natural predators in the
past, in the last 1,000 years

00:00:31.367 --> 00:00:34.467
or so, would have been the
likes of wolf and lynx,

00:00:34.467 --> 00:00:35.967
and now, because
the breed hasn't

00:00:35.967 --> 00:00:39.800
been interfered with too much,
now instinct's very strong.

00:00:42.333 --> 00:00:45.600
Mom's urge is still to
protect her newborn calf.

00:00:48.433 --> 00:00:51.166
So once she cleans
it and feeds it,

00:00:51.166 --> 00:00:55.934
she hides it in the
tall highland grass,

00:00:55.934 --> 00:01:00.233
leaving her free to graze
and regain her strength.

00:01:00.233 --> 00:01:02.800
It's an incredibly
instinctive technique,

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.300
which is bad news for Keith and
his daughter, Jess, who have

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.265
to keep tabs on new arrivals.

00:01:08.266 --> 00:01:09.533
All right.

00:01:09.533 --> 00:01:10.800
You start counting them
from up there, Jess.

00:01:20.333 --> 00:01:21.600
How many you got?
- 13.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.265
13.

00:01:22.266 --> 00:01:25.200
I was at 16.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.000
Like Houdinis, you
don't know where

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.066
they're going to appear from
or where they're being stashed.

00:01:30.066 --> 00:01:33.066
Ah, look, there they are.

00:01:33.066 --> 00:01:34.433
They're all tucked in, hiding.

00:01:34.433 --> 00:01:36.967
Little [inaudible].

00:01:36.967 --> 00:01:40.734
They all seem quite happy.

00:01:40.734 --> 00:01:43.767
If you hid your baby
and went out to dinner,

00:01:43.767 --> 00:01:47.133
you'd get a visit
from a social worker.

00:01:47.133 --> 00:01:52.133
But for animal moms, it's an
effective method of protection.

00:01:52.133 --> 00:01:54.899
And on the other side
of the world in Africa,

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:55.900
even cheetah moms hide their
babies to keep them safe.
