male narrator: This is Earth.
Maybe you've heard of it.

00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:04.371
I sure hope so

00:00:04.437 --> 00:00:06.973
because you live on one of
its seven continents.

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.809
This one's most known
for its desert landscapes

00:00:09.876 --> 00:00:11.311
and unique animals.

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:16.549
Australia is the smallest
of the seven continents,

00:00:16.616 --> 00:00:18.785
and it's entirely surrounded
by water.

00:00:18.852 --> 00:00:20.987
It's also the only country
in the world

00:00:21.054 --> 00:00:23.056
that covers
an entire continent.

00:00:23.123 --> 00:00:24.958
(dramatic music)

00:00:25.025 --> 00:00:27.460
At almost
3 million square miles,

00:00:27.527 --> 00:00:29.029
Australia is located
below Asia

00:00:29.095 --> 00:00:30.397
in the Southern Hemisphere

00:00:31.331 --> 00:00:32.732
That's how it got
its nickname,

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:35.602
the "land down under."

00:00:35.668 --> 00:00:38.505
Life down under
is very unusual.

00:00:38.571 --> 00:00:40.340
It can go from
scorching dry temperatures

00:00:40.407 --> 00:00:42.275
to very subtropical.

00:00:42.342 --> 00:00:43.977
In the Southern Hemisphere,

stars and constellations

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.181
appear upside down
and reversed

00:00:48.248 --> 00:00:49.949
compared
to the Northern Hemisphere.

00:00:50.016 --> 00:00:53.386
This is because
the Earth turn on its axis

00:00:53.453 --> 00:00:55.188
from the North
to the South Pole.

00:00:55.255 --> 00:00:57.424
Even the seasons
are in reverse.

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:00.226
So get out your winter parkas
in the summer

00:01:00.293 --> 00:01:03.029
and surf boards
during the holidays.

00:01:03.096 --> 00:01:04.330
(upbeat music)

00:01:04.397 --> 00:01:05.965
And you'll definitely
need sunscreen

00:01:06.032 --> 00:01:08.535

of Australia's many deserts.
