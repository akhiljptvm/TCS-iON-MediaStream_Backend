00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.390
- [Narrator] Millions of
years before industry,

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:06.920
agriculture and civilization

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:10.300
the world stage was set for one creature's

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.253
unprecedented rise.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.160
The story of humanity's evolution

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.770
began about seven million years ago

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.603
when the human lineage broke
away from that of chimpanzees.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:32.520
Over time an ensemble cast of
over 20 early humans species

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:35.073
or hominins came to the fore.

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:38.610
Most became extinct

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.363
while others might have been
ancestors to today's humans.

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.130
Each species exhibited varying degrees

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:49.070
of human like physical
and behavioral traits

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:54.070
such as large brains, small
teeth, bipedality and tool use.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.680
These hominins fell
into three major groups.

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.680
Early hominins,
australopithecines, and homo genus.

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.700
Humanity's earliest relatives

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.700
lived between seven and 4.4
million years ago in Africa.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.670
Having most recently
shared a common ancestor

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.920
with chimpanzees they
had many ape-like traits

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.860
such as a small cranial capacity.

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.040
However fossils show that
some ancient hominins

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.490
were also beginning to show
human-like characteristics

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.180
such as small canines that were
likely used more for eating

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.053
and not for hunting or fighting.

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:40.510
The next phase of hominin evolution

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:43.970
involved primates called
australopithecines.

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.330
They lived between 4.4
and 1.4 million years ago

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.203
across the African continent.

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:55.520
Like their ancient brethren

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.353
australopithecines had
some ape-like traits.

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.970
However changes in the
skull, spine and legs

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.980
indicate a notable shift
toward a very human-like trait.

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:12.653
Consistent bipedal locomotion.

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.620
The third and current
phase of human evolution

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.910
involves members of the genus homo.

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.810
The earliest homo species likely date

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.390
to more than two million years ago

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.773
making them a contemporary
of some australopithecines.

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.200
But unlike earlier hominins

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.760
who exhibited a mosaic of
ape and human-like traits.

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.463
Homo species were becoming
distinctly more human.

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.040
Their cranial capacity was growing larger

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.353
than any other hominins.

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.453
They developed sophisticated
stone tool technology.

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.173
And they became the first to control fire.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.190
These physical and behavioral adaptations

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.590
along with advancements in technology

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.300
allowed some homo species to be the first

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:08.153
to migrate out of Africa and
explore the rest of the world.

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.380
While a cast of over 20 hominin species

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.943
have walked this Earth only one remains.

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:22.200
Homo sapiens shaped by
millions of years of evolution

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.280
embarked on a journey of
exploration and industry

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.933
its ancestors could have only dreamed.
