00:00:00.459 --> 00:00:02.630
(mysterious music)

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:03.820
- [Woman] Black holes are among

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:06.920
the most fascinating
objects in our universe,

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:10.093
and also the most mysterious.

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:15.540
A black hole is a region in space

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.890
where the force of gravity is so strong,

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.320
not even light, the fastest known entity

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.053
in our universe, can escape.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.650
The boundary of a black hole
is called the event horizon,

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:30.653
a point of no return, beyond
which we truly cannot see.

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.920
When something crosses the event horizon,

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.970
it collapses into the
black hole's singularity,

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:40.160
an infinitely small,
infinitely dense point

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.853
where space, time, and the laws
of physics no longer apply.

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.450
Scientists have theorized
several different types

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.290
of black holes, with stellar
and supermassive black holes

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:53.930
being the most common.

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.720
Stellar black holes
form when massive stars

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.560
die and collapse.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.860
They're roughly 10 to 20
times the mass of our sun,

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.803
and scattered throughout the universe.

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:07.360
There could be millions of
these stellar black holes

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.803
in the Milky Way alone.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.040
Supermassive black holes
are giants by comparison,

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.530
measuring millions,
even billions of times,

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.880
more massive than our sun.

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.400
Scientists can only guess how they form,

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.550
but we do know they exist at the center

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.523
of just about every large
galaxy, including our own.

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.690
Sagittarius A, the supermassive black hole

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:33.230
at the center of the Milky Way,

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:36.020
has a mass of roughly four million suns,

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.020
and has a diameter about the distance

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.023
between the earth and our sun.

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:43.600
Because black holes are invisible,

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.820
the only way for scientists to detect

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.990
and study them is to observe their effect

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:49.900
on nearby matter.

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.000
This includes accretion disks,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.780
a disk of particles that
form when gases and dust

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.840
fall toward a black hole, and quasars,

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.860
jets of particles that blast out

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:01.943
of supermassive black holes.

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.703
Black holes remained largely
unknown until the 20th century.

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.140
In 1916, using Einstein's
general theory of relativity,

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.140
a German physicist named
Karl Schwartzschild

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.970
calculated that any mass
can become a black hole

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.023
if it were compressed tightly enough.

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:27.400
But it wasn't until 1971
when theory became reality.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.530
Astronomers studying
the constellation Cygnus

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.713
discovered the first black hole.

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.990
An untold number of black holes

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:38.370
are scattered throughout the universe,

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.970
constantly warping space and time,

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.500
altering entire galaxies,
and endlessly inspiring

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.803
both scientists and our
collective imagination.
