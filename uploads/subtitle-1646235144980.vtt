NARRATOR: A male black rhino
wants to mate with a female.

00:00:07.867 --> 00:00:10.400
But she's only interested
in protecting her calf.

00:00:17.734 --> 00:00:20.633
Even though she weighs
as much as a powerboat,

00:00:20.633 --> 00:00:24.467
he drives her backwards
through the dirt.

00:00:24.467 --> 00:00:27.867
[grunting]

00:00:27.867 --> 00:00:29.867
Kicking up huge clouds of dust.

00:00:37.934 --> 00:00:42.133
Now engulfed in the haze, her
calf is in extreme danger.

00:00:45.233 --> 00:00:49.000
Rhino eyesight is poor.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.834
In clear conditions, they can
only see up to 100 feet away.

00:00:57.033 --> 00:01:03.000
In the thick dust, the male
could easily trample the calf.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.467
The mother spins
around to run away,

00:01:06.467 --> 00:01:09.700
but the big male won't stop.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.800
In his frenzy, he uses his
deadly tip 2-foot long horn

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.567
and lifts her back end
clear off the ground.

00:01:21.166 --> 00:01:25.033
She may have
inch-thick hide, but he

00:01:25.033 --> 00:01:26.700
could still puncture her side.

00:01:32.734 --> 00:01:37.934
If she's injured, her baby's
life could be at risk.

00:01:37.934 --> 00:01:41.667
[grunting]

00:01:44.066 --> 00:01:45.667
The cloud begins to clear.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.333
And the baby is unharmed.

00:01:57.467 --> 00:02:01.000
The big bull realizes that even
though he can push this mother

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.500
around, she's no pushover.
