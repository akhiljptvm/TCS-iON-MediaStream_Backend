freshwater fish in the world oh that's

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:30.439

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.360
voracious appetite for fresh meat they

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:44.879
take chunks out of their prey with their

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:47.280
razor sharp teeth and don't even swallow

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.000
excuse him oh derek even though they are

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.559
small pound for pound some piranhas can

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.600
actually bite harder than a great white

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:58.239
shark usually feeding in large groups or

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.440
schools they locate their prey by scent

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:01.039
or motion

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.120

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:04.879
piranha can actually talk to each other

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.920
