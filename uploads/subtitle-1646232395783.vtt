00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:06.006
Healthy ecosystems support rich biodiversity.

00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:10.510
The Okavango Delta hosts one of the most vibrant on Earth.

00:00:19.936 --> 00:00:22.439
Pristine water from Angola

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.694
becomes the life force that sustains a vast variety of species.

00:00:35.785 --> 00:00:38.496
Two on the right! One on the left there!

00:00:46.171 --> 00:00:49.424
Each plays its part in supporting the system

00:00:49.424 --> 00:00:51.760
from the smallest

00:00:52.761 --> 00:00:54.345
to the largest.

00:01:01.686 --> 00:01:03.563
Year-round in the Delta,

00:01:03.563 --> 00:01:08.234
termites create nest mounds that form thousands of islands.

00:01:09.152 --> 00:01:11.237
Plant life takes root,

00:01:11.237 --> 00:01:15.325
recycling nutrients from the water and fortifying the soil.

00:01:16.451 --> 00:01:18.787
Elephants also build the Delta.

00:01:18.787 --> 00:01:22.207
The planet’s largest population live here.

00:01:22.207 --> 00:01:24.209
As ecological engineers,

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:27.003
they shape the landscape around them.

00:01:28.129 --> 00:01:31.174
Less than a week old. Seeds are sprouting already.

00:01:31.174 --> 00:01:34.594
The fresh elephant tracks are from a big lone bull.

00:01:34.594 --> 00:01:36.721
You can see they’re all torn apart.

00:01:36.721 --> 00:01:38.681
So he’s opening up a clearing here.

00:01:38.681 --> 00:01:42.060
And as a steward, he’s left this one.

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.311
He’s going to let it grow up.

00:01:43.311 --> 00:01:45.772
They’re choosing and managing this landscape.

00:01:45.772 --> 00:01:48.441
Such an important function. And without them,

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.445
the balance we speak about is lost.

00:01:54.572 --> 00:01:57.700
The Delta is protected in Botswana,

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.786
but it’s part of an ecosystem

00:01:59.786 --> 00:02:02.580
that extends back to its Angolan source waters

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.874
through unprotected land.

00:02:05.542 --> 00:02:09.462
Threats like land clearance are diminishing wildlife habitats,

00:02:09.462 --> 00:02:12.549
risking the whole ecosystem.

00:02:15.385 --> 00:02:19.305
That is why National Geographic is joined by De Beers

00:02:19.305 --> 00:02:21.599
through the Okavango Eternal partnership

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:26.396
to help ensure the biodiversity that supports this delicate ecosystem

00:02:26.396 --> 00:02:28.106
is protected.

00:02:28.982 --> 00:02:32.652
Okavango Eternal is building on research started by the

00:02:32.652 --> 00:02:35.738
National Geographic Okavango Wilderness Project

00:02:35.738 --> 00:02:39.492
who have studied the source rivers that supply the Delta.

00:02:40.034 --> 00:02:44.998
So far, over 50 species new to science have been discovered.

00:02:45.415 --> 00:02:48.918
Working together with local scientists and governments,

00:02:48.918 --> 00:02:52.297
Okavango Eternal will expand this research,

00:02:52.297 --> 00:02:56.718
supporting the protection of these species and their habitats.

00:02:56.926 --> 00:02:58.845
Connecting Angola to Botswana

00:02:58.845 --> 00:03:03.266
through one of the largest conservation corridors in the world,

00:03:03.266 --> 00:03:06.060
so that wildlife can exist safely,

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.023
supported by an ecosystem that keeps nature thriving

00:03:10.023 --> 00:03:12.692
and water flowing.
